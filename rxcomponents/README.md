## Motivation

The primary motivation for this microlib is dealing with `getActivity` within `Fragment`.  The way
this mechanism works under the hood appears to be confusing and slightly brittle.  This microlib
provides a container to provide the Activity when it is attached, and clear it when the Fragment is
destroyed.
