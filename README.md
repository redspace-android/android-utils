# Redspace Android-Utils

Redspace android-utils project is a collection of modules that provide useful functionality for Android developers.


## Getting Started

This project uses [JITpack](https://jitpack.io/#theREDspace/android-utils/) for packaging, which provides on-the-fly build capability to get a release, specific module, or specific tag/commit into your project.

Add the JITpack repository to your root `build.gradle` file:
```
allprojects {
 repositories {
    jcenter()
    maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
 }
}
```

Add dependency entries for each module to each of your interested modules' `build.gradle` files:
```
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.theREDspace.android-utils:${MODULE}:(release/tag/branch/commit)
}
```

Note: do not add the jitpack.io repository under buildscript.

Each directory in the project root (except `gradle`) is a module that can be imported.  Each module contains markdown with individual usage instructions.

Note that JITpack compiles components on demand, which means that, if you're the first user of a given commit, dependency resolution might fail the first time.  Please retry a few times before
reporting issues.
